Now that we are in the ticketing system we are going to set up our environment to simulate a real one. First, we are going to configure roles which are the permissions granted to Agents per department that they have access to. Once we login into the osTicket website we are going to head over to the admin panel, agents, and roles. This role is going to be name supreme adimn because we are going to give it every permissions that there is. Since tickets are routed through departments now we are going to configure one. Just by clicking on departments  we can add a new Department called system administrators don't worry about the SLAs just yet we can leave them on default for now.
